### Tax-Loss Harvesting

You invest $100k. It drops to $90k. If you sell and reinvest, you've "realized" a loss of $10k, which you can claim on your tax return, reducing the taxes you pay. But the amount you have invested stays the same.

If after the 10% decline, the reinvested money grows to $108k, you can still claim the $10k loss, because you "realized" it.
