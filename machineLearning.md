### Dropout

Ignoring nodes in a layer with some probability. Helps prevent overfitting.

### Features vs. labels

Features are inputs. Labels are outputs.

### AUC / AUROC

AUC usually means AUROC -- Area Under a Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve.

ROC curve is a visualization of how good a binary classifier is. A random one has AUC of 0.5; a perfect one has AUC of 1.

### Common Machine Learning Algorithms

From 2015 Quora answer:

Linear regression
Logistic regression
k-means
SVMs
Random Forests
Matrix Factorization/SVD
Gradient Boosted Decision Trees/Machines
Naive Bayes
Artificial Neural Networks
For the last one I'd let you pick one of the following:
Bayesian Networks
Elastic Nets
Any other clustering algo besides k-means
LDA
Conditional Random Fields
HDPs or other Bayesian non-parametric model
