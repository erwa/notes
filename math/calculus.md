### Gradient vs. Jacobian

Gradient of a scalar-valued multi-variable function is a vector whose elements are the partial derivatives of the function with respect to each variable.

Jacobian is generalization of gradient to vector-valued functions.

### Commutativity of partial derivatives

d/dx d/dy f(x,y) = d/dy d/dx f(x,y) if x and y are independent, implying dy/dx = dx/dy = 0
