### Formatting when copying Google Doc content

Update: Formatting is OK if user the new Outlook web interface.

Extra line breaks will appear unless you copy first to Word (offline or online) and then copy from Word to the Outlook email.


### Multiple accounts.

Office 365 does not allow being signed-in to multiple accounts at once.

Easiest workaround is to open one account in an incognito window.

When switching accounts, you may need to restart your web browser.


### Limitations

* Cannot filter by color categories. No point using them.
* Sender matching really sucks; easier to use email header matching.


### Keyboard shortcuts

```
* - start a bulleted list
1 - start a numbered list

Q - mark as read
U - mark as unread

Shift + R - reply all
R - reply

Cmd + N - new email
Cmd + Shift + 1 - Email
Cmd + Shift + 2 - Calendar
```
