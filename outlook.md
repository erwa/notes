### Multiple accounts.

Office 365 does not allow being signed-in to multiple accounts at once.

Easiest workaround is to open one account in an incognito window.

When switching accounts, you may need to restart your web browser.


### Limitations

* Cannot filter by color categories. No point using them.
* Sender matching really sucks; easier to use email header matching.


### Keyboard shortcuts

```
* - start a bulleted list
1 - start a numbered list

Q - mark as read
U - mark as unread

Shift + R - reply all
R - reply

Cmd + N - new email
Cmd + Shift + 1 - Email
Cmd + Shift + 2 - Calendar
```
