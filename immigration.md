### Green card through marriage

1) File I-130 "Petition for Alien Relative" to prove marriage. $535.
2) File I-485 "Adjustment of Status". $1225. Requires medical examination. Requires I-864 "Affidavit of Support" proving sponsoring spouse can support spouse seeking green card. May be combined with I-130 for spouses of U.S. citizens.
3) Green card interview to assess authenticity of marriage. Done at local USCIS office. If approved, green card generally arrives within 2-3 weeks.

If married for less than two years, will get CR1 "conditional" green card. Must then file I-751 "Petition to Remove Conditions on Residence" in 90-day period prior to expiration to remove conditions and obtain permanent green card. USCIS re-evaluates marraige.

Once married for more than 2 years, get IR1 "immediate relative" green card, which is valid for 10 years and you can renew.

### Green card through employer

1) PERM/Labor certification. PERM = Program for Electronic Review Management. Employer proves you are not taking jobs away from Americans. Generally 6-9 months.

2) I-140 petition. $700 filing fee for regular processing or $1225 for premium processing. Can take a few weeks to 6 months.

3) I-485 application to adjust status to permanent resident. Done after (1) and (2) approved by USCIS (U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services). Often the longest, only limited number of green cards available per category, so might wait a long time for priority date (based on when employer filed PERM or I-140). If I-140 approved and just waiting for priority date, you can extend H-1B past 6 years. For estimated priority date wait times, see "Final Action Dates for Employment-Based Preference Cases" in [Visa Bulletin](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/visa-law0/visa-bulletin.html).
