### Set up wifi printing in Samsung Easy Print Manager

May take a really long time to start up.

If not already in Advanced Mode (has a Device Settings tab), switch to Advanced Mode (shortcut-looking icon (with little arrow) in top-right).

Select printer -> Device Settings tab -> Internet settings

Under "Wifi Settings" -> Wizard to set up.
