May take a really long time to start up.

If not already in Advanced Mode (has a Device Settings tab), switch to Advanced Mode (shortcut-looking icon (with little arrow) in top-right).

Plug in the printer USB cable and click Refresh icon in top-right.

Select printer -> Device Settings tab -> Internet settings

Under "Wifi Settings" -> Wizard to set up.

May need to go to Settings -> Printers -> + (and hopefully the wireless printer will be a suggested result)

If the Wizard fails, turn off and turn on the printer and try again.

Don't enable Wi-Fi Direct (may screw up regular Wi-Fi printing).
