seems need to use
yarn run dev
but webpack not installed in Docker container
"webpack: not found" seen in web_1 docker logs

trying "docker-compose build --no-cache"

# in docker-entrypoint.sh
yarn run dev
# works from container CLI
# afterward, `docker-compose up` worked

# fails for fresh checkout

# seems yarn.lock is out-of-date

# use NVM to install Node, the apt version of node is out of date
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/nodejs/setup-on-wsl2

# after running `yarn install`, `docker-compose up` seems to work

FIX:
- move `COPY . .` up and remove all the other COPYs (superfluous)


# first time `docker-compose up` run
