non-contact voltage tester to find live wire
continuity to check connector wires

equipment
- phone
- screwdriver
- wire caps
- voltage detector
- continuity tool
- notebook to take notes
- electrical tape (RED TAPE)
- needle nose plier

0) CHECK WHAT SCREWDRIVER NEEDED, PREP GLOVES
1) turn off electricity
2) take cover plates off switches
3) use fluke voltage detector - touch all around to make sure electricity is off
3b) TAKE PICTURES
4) remove all wires from light switch
5) might be white wire for live, should be recolored.
6) put wire nuts over every wire
7) turn on electricity briefly
8) use fluke voltage detector to figure out LINE wire (LIVE, HOT wire). only 1 of 2 boxes should have a hot wire
9) move that aside, PUT TAPE on it
10) turn electricity off. DOUBLE CHECK with non-contact voltage detector
11) figure out traveler and ground wires. live wire go to BLACK COMMON SCREW. green ground wire goes to GREEN screw. traveler wires go to BRONZE screws
12) figure out LOAD wire
13) hook the 2 traveler wires together on LIVE switch
14) then can test continuity in other box, find traveler wires, put aside; put LOAD wire aside (that goes to black COMMON screw). can mark that with red tape, too.
15) wire it, put it all together.
