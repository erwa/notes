### Tax-loss harvesting

When your investment loses value, if you sell and buy something comparable, total value stays the same but you've realized a capital loss, which is tax-deductible. However, you can't sell and buy something "substantially identical" within 30 days. But you can buy something correlated but not substantially identical. Generally speaking, different stocks, even in the same industry, are NOT considered substantially identical. Up to $3000 of loss is tax deductible.

### Mutual Fund Capital Gains Distribution

You might see capital gain distributions associated with your mutual funds, even though you didn't sell any shares. This happens because when the fund manager sells assets and incurs capital gains, these capital gains are passed onto the shareholders.

### Tax-Loss Harvesting

You invest $100k. It drops to $90k. If you sell and reinvest, you've "realized" a loss of $10k, which you can claim on your tax return, reducing the taxes you pay. But the amount you have invested stays the same.

If after the 10% decline, the reinvested money grows to $108k, you can still claim the $10k loss, because you "realized" it.

http://www.investopedia.com/articles/taxes/08/tax-loss-harvesting.asp

Restrictions:
- Cannot buy/sell "substantially identical" stocks within 30 days. Applies to both buy then sell and sell then buy. Generally, if you buy a different stock, that is considered NOT substantially identical.

### Roth 401k vs traditional 401k

Contributions to Roth 401k are taxed, but earnings are not taxed, and distributions are not taxed.

401k is not taxed immediately but taxed when distributed. Earnings are taxed at distribution time.

With a traditional 401k, the account value will be larger at retirement, but you'll have to pay taxes on distributions (which include your earnings).

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roth_401(k)


### 401k vs. IRA

* IRA has wider investment selections.
* No penalty for withdrawing contributions to Roth IRA early.
* 401k has $18k/yr contribution limit (across all 401k accounts)

### Non-deductible contributions to traditional IRA

You cannot take any deductions for your Traditional IRA contributions if your income exceeds some threshold. Most software engineers will exceed this threshold. When you convert a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA, you only have to pay taxes on the tax-deductible contributions and the earnings.

It seems if you cannot take any deductions for your traditional IRA contributions and you can immediately convert a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA after contributing, then it's strictly better to go with a Roth IRA.

### Rollover vs. Transfer

From Vanguard: "A rollover is a way to move assets between retirement plans (such as from a 401(k) plan to another 401(k) plan), or from a retirement plan to an IRA (such as from a 401(k) or 403(b) to an IRA).

A transfer is a way to move assets from a retirement account (such as an IRA) or a nonretirement account (such as an individual or joint account) from one financial firm to another."

https://apps.vanguard.com/web/cf/move-money/account-type


### IRA Rollover / IRA Conversion

In general, you can only rollover one IRA to another in any 12-month period. However, many exceptions.

The following are unlimited:
- trustee-to-trustee transfer (one custodian to another without client touching money)
- traditional to Roth conversion
- IRA to plan (e.g.: 401k)
- plan (e.g.: 401k) to IRA
- plan to plan

Converting (or "rolling over") from traditional IRA to Roth IRA is a taxable event. You can do an unlimited number of conversions from traditional to Roth IRA per 12-month period.

Anyone can convert a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA, regardless of income. Wealthfront lets you do it easily: [https://blog.wealthfront.com/wealthfront-now-offers-easy-roth-conversions/]()

If you earn too much to contribute directly to Roth, then you also earn too much to do pre-tax contributions to a traditional IRA. But you can immediately convert traditional IRA contributions to a Roth IRA, and you don't have to pay taxes again during the conversion.
