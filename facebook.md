Best option: upload videos, then include links to them from pictures.

Upload video privately by posting it to your Timeline with visibility set to Only Me. Later change it to Friends. Alternatively, after uploading video, navigate to Videos -> My Videos -> video -> Options -> Get Link and use that.
