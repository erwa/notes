### Freestanding vs. Non-freestanding Tents

Freestanding tents (like Kelty Salida 2) use poles to maintain shape.
Non-freestanding tents require rope/cord attached to stakes.

Thread through, take loose end in two fingers, go over standing line, spin, go around line, back through loop. If you pull through loop from left to right, wrap under from left to rigth as well. You're going through same loop in both directions. Loop should be on loose end side.

Loop, tail end under. Thread upward (bottom to top) (same as tail end).


### Stoves

MSR WindBurner stove. Packs together nicely -- all in mug pot itself. About 5 min to boil 20 oz of water.
